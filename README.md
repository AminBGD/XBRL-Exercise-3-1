# XBRL-Exercise-3-1
You will complete Exercises 3-1 and 3-2 in your XBRL textbook. The exercises are found on pages 47 - 50.

You should create an xbrl document for each financial statement. Each must be a well-formed xml document.

You must include all header information, create context elements as needed, then add the facts for all items in the financial statements using appropriate element names from the taxonomy. Include the elements for the two years shown consecutively (e.g. Cash 2022, Cash 2021 then the next element on the financial statements.)

You are not to discuss the exam with others. You can use your textbook, SEC filings, and the XBRL taxonomy to identify and complete the requirements. 

You can ignore the "Rendering for Human Consumption" instructions. You do not need to add a stylesheet. You are only required to complete the xbrl tagging of all of the elements.
